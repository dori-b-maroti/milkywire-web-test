If I had more time:
- I'd add test coverage for the created code
- I'd add a React page navigation library to the project and use that for the login part (HomePage/ImpacterProfile)
- I'd fix styling issues, such as vertically bigger files break the modal mode, as the user cannot see the buttons to navigate or close down the Modal window
- I'd add confirmation window when deleting a post and when saving a post when edited
- I'd add support for the user to create a new post by uploading a new image
